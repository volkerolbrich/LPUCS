#  Linux Power Utils Collection Script (LPUCS)

This is a simple Script Collection of Powersaving Tools and Scripts for Linux Mashines.

Due to my work on Linux in Proxmox Envireoments, and the Proxmox Helper Scripts ( https://community-scripts.github.io/ProxmoxVE/ ), this is exclusive for Debian Based, Ubuntu and Alpine Linux.

Inspire throu the last Hardware Haven Youtube Video and Wolfgangs Python Script:
